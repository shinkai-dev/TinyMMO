# TinyMMO
A indie MMO game made in Godot 3.5 .NET

# Instructions

<p>Load the project.</p>
<p>You will require two separate instances of Godot to run it locally. One of them will be the client and the other one will be the server.</p>
<p>It's recommended to have one instance with the project loaded in the editor and the other one in Godot's Project manager, so after compiling you can just Run it through the project manager without having any conflicts.</p>
